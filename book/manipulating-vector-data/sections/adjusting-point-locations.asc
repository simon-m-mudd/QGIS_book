=== Adjusting point locations

Handheld https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System[GPS] units are often used in the field to determine location of sampling points. The accuracy of GPS measurements varies, and if you are working with a relatively high resolution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model[DEM] (e.g., 5 m resolution or better).

In this example we will look at some point data that was collected in a channel. We have extracted drainage area (using https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTopoTools_workshop/[LSDTopoTools]), in the image below the channels are those with high drainage area and have purple colours:


.Point data aver drainage area

In this image, you can see that the channel point locations are not all on the channel. THis is beacuse the DEM has a pixel size of 5 metres and the error on the GPS unit is greater than 5 metres. Also, in some cases the channel routing algorithms, combined with a noisy DEM, route the channels to the wrong place. In addition, one of these points seems spurious (the one anomolously to the East), so we might remove it from the dataset. 

To edit the points, right click on the layer (not the csv file but a vector layer you created in <<Saving your imported data,previous steps>>) and select "toggle editing":


.Enable editing of vector data

Once you do this the editing toolbar will become active:

You can then select the "node tool" to move nodes to the channel. You can also delete nodes.

You can either save or roll back edits (if you are unhappy with your work) by clicking on the icon with several pencils:

Once you are finished editing make sure you turn the editing back off using the "toggle editing" button. 

=== Extracting data from a raster onto points

Another common operation is to extract raster data onto points. There is a handy tutorial about this already: http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/sampling_raster_data.html, but we are going to use the previous dataset here. 

First, you need to click on the *plugins* menu bar and select "manage and install plugins":

.Opening the plugins browser

Search for "point sampling tool" and install:

.Get the point sampling tool

Once you do that, the "point sampling tool" can be found under the plugins menu:

.Selecting the point sampling tool

.Important notes about the point sampling tool
*****************************************************************
I have some bad news: the point sampling tool is very picky about the data you can use. Here are some gotchas:

. If you edited your vector file and deleted a point, it turns out that point is stull there, but has a "NULL" data entry. The extract point tool does not like this one bit. It is very hard to get rid of these points in a shapefile. In a geojson file, you can open the file, delete the point with "null" in the line, and save the file. 
. All of the layers need to be in the same projection. Because raster layers take up a lot of space you should check on your raster's projection and then save your vector data in that same projection. Right click on the layer, select "save as" and then on the CRS button select the same projection as your raster. 
*****************************************************************


Select the layer from which to extract data, and use the "browse" button to save the file. In addition, I recommend keeping all of the data in the original vector file:

.Extracting the data using the point sampling tool

NOTE: The point extraction tool can only save files as ESRI shapefiles. 

You can then right click on the new layer, view the attribute table and copy the data into a clipboard:


.Copy the data to clipboard

This can then be pasted into a spreadsheet.
