== Preface by Simon Mudd

Calling this a "book" is a bit presumptious: in actuality this is a collection of notes on how to do simple operations within QGIS. It stems from a http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/16-17/dpt/cxgegr10094.htm[course at Edinburgh] where the topic is http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/what-geomorphology-0[Geomorphology] but for the course project students need to analyse topographic data. This is not meant to be a course on QGIS! It is instead notes on the QGIS you need to know to look at data.
