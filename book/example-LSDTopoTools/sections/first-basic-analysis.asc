=== A first basic analysis

This first example is extremely simple but it will introduce you to calling *LSDTopoTools* programs.

All *LSDTopoTools* programs are called from a terminal window. They read a file, which we call either a *parameter* or *driver* file which tell the program what to do. When you call the program, you need to tell it where this driver file is. You do this by telling the program the directory in which the *driver* file is located, and the name of the *driver* file. 

The *LSDTopoTools* program we will be using is called `LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out`. 

. We have put this program online. There are three different versions, since it has been compiled for a few different linux environments:
+
* If you are at Edinburgh, the program is called `LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out`. It works on Scientific Linux 7.
* If you are using our vagrant 32 bit ubuntu system, the program is called `LSDTT_BasicMetrics_U64.out`.
* If you are using our vagrant 64 bit ubuntu system, the program is called `LSDTT_BasicMetrics_U32.out`.
+
. Get the version for your operating system. For example, if you are using the Edinburgh servers, get it with:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data/master/LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out
----
+
. Use `ls` to make sure this program and all the data you downloaded from the last section is in the same folder.

==== The driver file for the first analysis

. Before we run the program we need to modify the driver file. The first driver file looks like this:
+
[source,paramfile]
----
# Parameters for extracting simple surface metrics
# Comments are preceeded by the hash symbol
# Documentation can be found here: 
# https://simon-m-mudd.github.io/QGIS_book/#_an_example_using_data_from_lsdtopotools

# These are parameters for the file i/o
# IMPORTANT: You MUST make the write directory: the code will not work if it doens't exist. 
read path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data
write path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data
read fname: WA
write fname: WA_FirstExample
channel heads fname: NULL

# The data that you want printed to file
write_hillshade: true
----


. Before we run the model, we need to ensure that the *driver* functions point to the correct data. Copy the location of the data by using the `pwd` command (see last section), and past that in to the
