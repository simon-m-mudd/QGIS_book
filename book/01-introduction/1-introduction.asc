== Background and Motivation

http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS] is a free and open source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system[Geographic Information System] (GIS). This book contains instructions on how to to basic operations within http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS]. It is not meant to be a QGIS course, but rather should get you started if you just want to look at some data. 

If you want to actually gain a deeper understanding of QGIS there are many excellent resources out there:

* http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/learning_resources.html A curated collection of QGIS leanring resources
* http://qgis-tutorials.mangomap.com/ A series of brief videos explaining simple QGIS tasks 
* http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/3651/where-to-find-qgis-tutorials-and-web-resources Another list of QGIS resources. 

In addition, QGIS now has a large, active and growing user community and if you type in a question about QGIS into a search engine you are almost certain to find a solution to your problem. 

So, with all of these fantastic resources, why, you ask, am I writing these notes? In short, my students tend to want to do a very specific set of tasks and so these notes give instructions for the things that I know my student need to know. Hopefully the result is slightly more efficient then sending many students separately to many different websites.
